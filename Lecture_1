                                                          -: Introduction to Prompt Engineering:-
Definition:-
             Prompt Engineering involves designing and refining prompts for language models.
Role of LLMs:-
              Large Language Models (LLMs) are central to prompt engineering.
              LLMs interpret and respond to prompts based on their training data.
Applications:-
              Used in various fields such as customer service, content creation, and data analysis.

Use of AI Models:
i. Creative Text Generation. [Craft different formats like Poems, scripts, or Product descriptions based on your prompts.]
ii. Enhanced Content Creation. [Automate content generation from websites, marketing materials, and social media posts across media formats, such as text, image, and video, to effectively prompt.]
iii. Improved Question-Answering. [Formulate clean prompts to get accurate answers from AI models based on their knowledge.]
iv. Image & Video Generation. [Using AI to generate images, videos, and illustrations.]
v. Code Generation & Review. [Crafts prompt to guide AI models in generating Basic code, functionalities, or reviewing existing code for improving and finding errors.]
Benefits:-
           Improves the accuracy and relevance of responses from language models.
           Enhances user experience and efficiency in tasks involving LLMs.
Principles:-
            Focus on clarity and specificity in prompt design.
            Iterative testing and refinement of prompts.
i. Give Direction ii. Specify Format 
iii. Provides Examples iv. Divide Labor 
v. Evaluate Quality 


Brief History:-
               Prompt engineering has evolved alongside advancements in AI and machine learning.
